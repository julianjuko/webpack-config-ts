Minimal webpack config for ts libraries

Lately I've had to do a lot of webpack config for React apps and modules, and it's *hard*. Especially when you throw TypeScript into the mix. The last straw was trying to configure a library written in TypeScript; a base minimal config was required for this kind of thing.

This repository is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is sick of seeing webpack errors and wishes they were able to run `yarn build` and spit out the packaged files and types correctly. 

Many thanks to [@lmiller1990](https://github.com/lmiller1990) for helping me determine the ideal config for my usual frontend stack.
