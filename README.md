# webpack-config-ts

Lately I've had to do a lot of webpack config for React apps and modules, and it's *hard*. Especially when you throw TypeScript into the mix.

This repository is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is sick of seeing webpack errors and wishes they were able to run the `yarn build` commmand and spit out a simple webpacked `main.js` (at least with React, TypeScript and Sass loaded for now).

Many thanks to [@lmiller1990](https://github.com/lmiller1990) for helping me determine the ideal config for my usual frontend stack.
